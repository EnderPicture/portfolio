                <p class="side-padding">As part of the second year Interactive Arts course, IAT 222, I was in a group
                    of four, we created an immersive experience where the participant donned an audio-visual headpiece
                    controlled by an external participant. The goal was to take them on a journey where they get lost
                    in time. In this project, I programmed the front end and back end with web technologies for
                    greatest compatibility and flexibility.</p>

                <p class="side-padding">Our art installation has five component to consider. A server to host the web
                    server and socket server, a client for the first participant to have the audiovisual experience in
                    the headset, a client for the first participant to press and hold to record the time, a MultiCam
                    control station where a second participant can try to mess up the first participant's sense of time
                    even more, and a data visualization client where all the past participants' are shown.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">One of the challenges I had was keeping the videos in sync between devices. I
                    tried just sending a sync command from the video player to the MultiCam player. This created
                    jerkiness in the video because there is latency between when it was sent to when it was received.
                    So, I compensated by adding a condition where if the two videos have drifted too much apart, like
                    one-tenth, of a second, the multicam footage will be corrected, but otherwise, just let it play.
                </p>
                <p class="side-padding">Another problem I solved was how to map a playing video's code onto a longer
                    clip. This was solved with some timecode math and multiplier that was kept at both the multicam and
                    video player's code.

            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">One of the decisions I made was putting the actual timing mechanism on both the
                    hold down button and the multi-cam switching. To avoid a bad connection messing with the timer,
                    when a participant holds down a button, a timer is started locally and a timer down event is passed
                    into the server and out into the timer display on the multi-cam computer. This makes for a smooth
                    timer that does not stutter because of latency. When the participant stops holding the button, the
                    local timer stopped, sends the final accurate time information to the timer display, and records it
                    in the visualization. This solution ensures the accuracy and the smoothness of the timer while
                    keeping accuracy up and packets low.</p>

                    interested in the project and wanted to beat other people’s scores. We’ve found that people are
                    really competitive, and their time perception is almost never perfect. Our Artwork received a full
                    mark at the end of the course and was shown as an example during the fall 2018 lecture. Through
                    this experience, I have learnt how to integrate several parts of my skill set into one functioning
                    product, how to hook up several computers to create a reliable network, and how to sync two video
                    players together so they are playing at the exact time code with clip offsets.</p>

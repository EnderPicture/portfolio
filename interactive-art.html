                <p class="side-padding">This project took place during spring 2018 IAT 222 project where the final
                    project was an interactive art project in groups of 4. During the 2 months given for this project,
                    we created a unique art piece that was displayed at the SIAT's interactive art festival at the end
                    of the semester. We created an immersive experience where the participant donned a headpiece and
                    had the audio-visual inside controlled by an external participant. The goal was to take them on a
                    journey where they get lost in time. In this project, I programmed the front end and back end with
                    web technologies for greatest compatibility and flexibility.</p>

            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">When I was designing the system, I know that there needed to be several
                    interaction points modes, where these programs will run are unknown, and how they are going to run
                    are unknown as well. This is because we have not secured any devices to run the installation, we do
                    not know the capabilities of those devices, and where we are going to display the final
                    installation. Having stuff split up into its bare essentials will ensure that things can run
                    smoothly with any equipment we got. I know I would need a video player and graphics in the same
                    interface, and everything all with a real-time connection. This is why I chose the web. Because I
                    know it can play videos with the HTML5 video player, draw graphics, and communicate with servers.
                    When choosing which computer will be the central server, I’ve chosen the one with playing the
                    highest quality video (3000x2000 30fps) because this will all have to be streamed over wifi and
                    handling over LocalHost will be way better.</p>

                <p class="side-padding">This server uses the hub-spoke model of communication as it was the simplest to
                    implement in the shortest amount of time. There are 4 separate parts in this artwork that needs to
                    be addressed. The headset video player (using a surface book tablet portion), Hold down button,
                    Visualization player, and multi-cam video switcher/timer display. When a client connects, they are
                    given a choice between the 4 modes, and the web page dynamically changes with the choice and
                    communicates with the server about the action.</p>

                <p class="side-padding">One of the decisions I made was putting the actual timing mechanism on both the
                    hold down button and the multi-cam switching. To avoid a bad connection messing with the timer,
                    when a participant holds down a button, a timer is started locally and a timer down event is passed
                    into the server and out into the timer display on the multi-cam computer. This makes for a smooth
                    timer that does not stutter because of latency. When the participant stops holding the button, the
                    local timer stopped, sends the final accurate time information to the timer display, and records it
                    in the visualization. This solution ensures the accuracy and the smoothness of the timer while
                    keeping accuracy up and packets low.</p>

                    interested in the project and wanted to beat other people’s scores. We’ve found that people are
                    really competitive, and their time perception is almost never perfect. Our Artwork received a full
                    mark at the end of the course and was shown as an example during the fall 2018 lecture. Through
                    this experience, I have learnt how to integrate several parts of my skill set into one functioning
                    product, how to hook up several computers to create a reliable network, and how to sync two video
                    players together so they are playing at the exact time code with clip offsets.</p>

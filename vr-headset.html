                <h3>User persona: stargazer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can be used outside</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Design constraint</h3>
                <p>One of the constraints we had while designing this VR headset is that we were
                    constrained to using two different materials, wood and plastic, at roughly a 50/50 ratio on the
                    exterior. This restriction makes it not feasible to create compound curves. When I was sketching, I
                    kept the tools available to us in mind, which is a laser cutter for wood and a 3d printer for
                    plastic.</p>

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">first iteration</h2>
            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">In the first iteration, a challenge I had was how to convert a 3D model from
                    Maya to a laser cut file. I thought about UV unwrapping it but the UV map exporter only exports in
                    raster formats. After a couple hours of research, I've found a script that can set each vertex's
                    coordinates to UV coordinates, creating a flat plane model in the 3d view, which that can be
                    rendered by the Maya's vector renderer. The result was an illustrator file that needed very little
                    editing to get into a laser cutter readable format.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-2third side-padding">

                    <figcaption>First iteration sketch model</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>


            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">second iteration</h2>


            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">The second iteration model was made to see how it fits around the face. It came
                    out really well. This first attempt at form fitting the face went well because I used a 90th
                    percentile sized 3D scanned head to make my contours around the face.</p>
                <p class="side-padding">The model was made out of cardstock since it is easy to laser cut, folds right
                    on the dashed lines, and won't buckle at non-perforated lines. This helps in the folding and gluing
                    process. A problem we faced was accounting in for the paper thickness because we did not know what
                    kind of cardstock we were going to use to cut. So, when assembling, we needed to put a lot of
                    effort into stretching and glueing for the top part to complete the shell to close.</p>

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">final iteration</h2>

            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">In the second iteration, everything went really well. I was really proud of my
                    work making the 3D printed STL file and laser cut file. </p>
                <p class="side-padding">The 3D print STL file was created in SolidWorks with a single model split into
                    4, each with added support for hinges, alignment slots, and draft angles for a nice fit while
                    glueing.</p>
                <p class="side-padding">The Laser cut file was created using the UV unwrapped Maya geometry with
                    manual scaling to match the size of the real size model. Each face of the unwrapped model was
                    mapped with a flexible wood cutting pattern. This enables us to curve the wood in compound curves.</p>

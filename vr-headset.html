            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">design Context</h2>

            <div class="flex-1third side-padding">
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/vr-prototype.jpg">
                </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-2third">
                <p class="side-padding">Our headset will be used outdoors, during evenings with clear skies, since we plan for it to be used to help our persona stargaze. The headset will aid our persona in identifying different constellations, or show a clearer images of the stars without light pollution getting in the way. As such, since the headset is mostly used as an aid, it will be taken on and off fairly frequently so our persona can compare the view in the headset, with the actual view outdoors. For example, our user would be taking a walk outdoors during a camping trip, and he could take the headset with him during the walk to learn about the stars he can see during his walk. Heâ€™ll be keeping the headset on for the entire walk, so he can flip the headset up or down depending on if he wants to see the physical stars, or the virtual stars with all the information about them attached to it.</p>
                <p class="side-padding">One of the constraints we had while designing this VR headset is that we were constrained to using two different materials, wood and plastic, at roughly a 50/50 ratio on the exterior. This restriction makes it not feasible to create compound curves. When I was sketching, I kept the tools available to us in mind, which is a laser cutter and a 3d printer.</p>

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">cutting</h2>

            <div class="flex-2third side-padding">

                    <img src="img/vr-lasercut.jpg">

            </div>
            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">For cutting and trimming, we decided to divide the list of parts into two major categories: parts that need to be cut precisely and parts that can allow minor uncertainties. Ideally, for accuracy and precision, all parts should be cut by laser cutters and printed by 3D printers; however, due to time, resource, and requirements, we had to complete some parts by hand and these parts included ones that does not require extremely high precision. In other words, the lid, the temple straps, the polystyrene and the soft PVC mat was cut by hand.</p>

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">assembly</h2>

            <div class="flex-2third side-padding">

            </div>
            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">Once all the pieces from the 3D printer were finished and the supports were all dissolved, we picked up the pieces from Solidspace. We printed out the pieces with little tabs in them so we could glue them back together easily with methyl chlorate. During the process, we also glued the lenses into the headset. After we finished glueing our structure together, we could then glue the wood onto the structure. Luckily, the laser cut wood bent nicely to the curves of the structure, and we were able to glue it onto the plastic with wood glue. For the lid, we took a hinge from our boxes, and screwed it to connect the lid and the plastic structure. We also added a small dowel to the plastic structure, so it would help hold the hinge in place. Lastly, we had to assemble the strap for the head. We cut holes into the PVC/styrene strap with a hole puncher, and tied it to the holes we made in the arms of the headset.</p>

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">finishing</h2>

            <div class="flex-2third side-padding">

            </div>
            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">The finishing for the parts happened simultaneously to the assembly, since different parts needed to be in different stages before we could add finishing to it. The first stage would be using super glue to glue any wooden edges that did not join with the 3D printed plastic parts. Next, varnish was added to the wood to help protect it from the outside elements and help keep its shape. Third, the varnish coating was sanded using a 320 grit fine sandpaper to remove unflat drips of varnish. Last, to make the headset comfortable to wear, we lined the edges of the inside with PVC.</p>

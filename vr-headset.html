                    In a group of three, we designed, prototyped, and created the final VR headset within a time span
                    of 2 months.</p>
                <p class="side-padding">This course is focused on how materials behave, manufacturing techniques,
                    product design. The final project is an example of that where we were given two randomly chosen
                    materials we had to use to complete our prototype. In this case, plastic and wood. We also have to
                    design for ergonomics, ease of use, and for a persona.

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">design context</h2>


            <div class="flex-2third">
                <p class="side-padding">Our headset will be used outdoors, during evenings with clear skies, since we
                    plan for it to be used to help our persona stargaze. The headset will aid our persona in
                    identifying different constellations, or show a clearer images of the stars without light pollution
                    getting in the way. As such, since the headset is mostly used as an aid, it will be taken on and
                    off fairly frequently so our persona can compare the view in the headset, with the actual view
                    outdoors. For example, our user would be taking a walk outdoors during a camping trip, and he could
                    take the headset with him during the walk to learn about the stars he can see during his walk.
                    Heâ€™ll be keeping the headset on for the entire walk, so he can flip the headset up or down
                    depending on if he wants to see the physical stars, or the virtual stars with all the information
                    about them attached to it.</p>
                <p class="side-padding">One of the constraints we had while designing this VR headset is that we were
                    constrained to using two different materials, wood and plastic, at roughly a 50/50 ratio on the
                    exterior. This restriction makes it not feasible to create compound curves. When I was sketching, I
                    kept the tools available to us in mind, which is a laser cutter and a 3d printer.</p>

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">first iteration</h2>
            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">I started with sketching out different forms that I thought would look cool and
                    fit the persona of our project. With many to choose from, I chose one that could be good for a
                    sketch model and went on making it viable for manufacture with the tools that we have. The one I've
                    chosen have plenty of curves that might cause problems when making the sketch model, so I went on
                    Maya to explore possibilities at the low poly style and possible flat packing solutions for the
                    sketch model. I also imported a 3d head model to form the initial face device interface. One
                    problem I faced when exporting the 3d model for laser cutting was how to export the UV unwrap file
                    to a vector based file format. After a couple hours of research, I've found a script that can set
                    each vertex's coordinates to UV coordinates, creating a flat plain model in the 3d view lower that
                    can be rendered by the Maya's vector renderer. </p>

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">second iteration</h2>


            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">When making the second iteration of the physical prototype, I updated the Maya
                    model so it looks better when sized to fit the actual VR headset. Having a higher polygon model,
                    but only in one axis, which allows this design to still be flattened and laser cut. A thing I
                    thought about was how can the headset be constructed so it can fit around the face nicely. I found
                    that there are 3d scanned focal models online that I can scale to 90th percentile head size to use
                    as a reference for the VR headset. The second sketch model is made out of cardstock since it is
                    easy to laser cut, folds right on the dashed lines, and won't buckle at non-perforated lines. This
                    helps in the folding and gluing process. A problem we faced was accounting in for the paper
                    thickness because we did not know what kind of cardstock we were going to use to cut. So, when
                    assembling, we needed to put a lot of effort stretching and glueing the top part to complete the
                    shell.</p>

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">final iteration</h2>

            <div class="flex-1third">
                <p class="side-padding">In the final model, I exported my slightly modified second Maya model into
                    SolidWorks, which I can then play connect the dots game and loft the surfaces out. Through adding
                    thickness to these surfaces and multiple boolean operations, the base 3d model shell is formed.
                    Since we need to use wood and plastic in roughly 50/50 bases on the outside and we have plenty of
                    curves, we had to use extremely thin, laser cut wood. This means that wood cannot be a structural
                    element of the headset. ABS 3d printed plastic shell was created using the solid works model that
                    was split into 4 pieces to fit inside the 3d printer. Each piece have alignment pegs to help
                    alignment when assembling and glueing. The laser-cut pattern on the thin plywood was created first
                    using the un triangulated UV unwrap pattern from Maya, then for every single quad, we had to map a
                    vector cut pattern onto it using a special plugin that allows for 4 corners free transform. This is
                    to allow for the curve to create the double radius curve needed in this project.</p>

            <h2 class="flex-full section-title">reflection</h2>
            <div class="flex-2third">
                <p class="side-padding">During the course of this project, I've applied and extended a lot of what I have hearned in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology. With solid works, I have learned a full array of new features include boolean operations, derived parts, importing files from Maya and lofting. I have learnt what software is good for what task. For example, Maya is great with organic shapes and making the first two iterations, but does not do well with boolean operations and precise drafting goals. Solidworks, on the other hand, is not very flexible when it comes to creating organic forms. Manufacturing processes and tolerances are also something I have come away with. The laser beam has a width that needs to be accounted for minimum cut distance. 3D printers have support materials to worry about and the orientation of how it is printed effects the structural integrity in one direction. At the end at the final public showcase, many people were impressed with the final project and it fits perfectly around the professor's head. We received the highest mark in the class for this project.</p>
